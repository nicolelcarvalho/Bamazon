# Bamazon

### Overview

Created during Week 7 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to use Node JS and MySQL to create an Amazon-like storefront. 

The app takes in 3 different commands: bamazonCustomer, bamazonManager and bamazonSupervisor. 

- As the customer, the user can purchase products available for sale. 
- As the manager, the user can edit the products available for sale and adjust inventory levels. 
- As the supervisor, the user can track product sales across the store's departments and view profit by department. 

All data will be logged to your terminal/bash window.

### Getting Started

- Clone down repo.
- Run command 'npm install' in Terminal or GitBash
- Run one of the commands listed below.

### What Each Command Does / Demonstration of Each Command

1. `node bamazonCustomer`

  	* All products available for sale will be displayed in a table along with their product ID# and price
  	* As the customer, you have the ability to purchase a product by the product ID#
  	* The customer inputs the product ID# and number of units they would like to buy
  	* Then, a receipt prints to the console that totals the customer's purchase

3. Joining the products table & departments table by department Name and summing product sales by department. 

	* Profit by department is calculated on the fly in the bamazonSupervisor.js file and is not stored in MySQL as per the instructions in the assignment.
