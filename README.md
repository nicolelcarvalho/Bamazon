# Bamazon

### Overview

Created during Week 7 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to use Node JS and MySQL to create an Amazon-like storefront. 

The app takes in 3 different commands: bamazonCustomer, bamazonManager and bamazonSupervisor. 
	* As the customer, the user can purchase products available for sale. 
	* As the manager, the user can edit the products available for sale and adjust inventory levels. 
	* As the supervisor, the user can track product sales across the store's departments and view profit by department. 
	* *All data will be logged to your terminal/bash window.*

### Getting Started
